# BadAngularCalculator

This project is to demonstrate a bug in my calculator code!

# Getting started

Start by cloning this repository.

##### Install dependencies
> npm i

##### Install the angular CLI if you don't have it already
> npm install -g @angular/cli

##### Run locally using angular

> ng serve --open

Use the calculator, and see if you can see what's wrong with it.
Then see if you can find in the code where the problem is!
